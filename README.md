# Renewable Energy Fund App

This is a React Native app created for a Coderbyte test project using Redux and mocked api.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the repository and install all dependencies

After cloning this project to your local machine run the following command to install all the dependencies:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn 
```

If you intent to run this project on iOS(XCode), you should also install all Pod dependecies:

```bash
npx pod-install ios
```

### Step 2: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, by running the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
